ch6: misc.c: getPassageTo parameterize player->location
ch7: misc.c: distanceTo parameterize player->location
ch7: misc.h: distPlayer --> distSelf
ch7: move.c: investigate whether we can simplify that

code07/move.c - case distHereContained:
'get gold' should work because box's health == 0

ch13: objectWithinReach heeft extra param; unused; under construction?

new chapter 14: multiple arguments
because there is more to it than just the parser:
- order of patterns
- breadth-first distance handling
- difficult semantics; how to respond to "put key in door"?
ch14: you can ask silver from guard when you are in the cave;
      you can get gold from box when you are in the field
ch14: 2-param get/put have same impl as ask/give; must refine
change argument for introducing 2-param commands: put gold in box

sort object.txt

copyright/copyleft

ch8: leg uit dat het nog niet perfect is (geen objDup)

ch15: listObjectsAtLocation: make visible light exit in dark location
ch15: cannot see cave exit; can "go <location>" between dark locations
ch15: "turn on lamp" works, "turn lamp on" does not

more chapters:
12. Open and close
- uitleg rugzak, en andere objecten die meeliften met objecten (coin + eagle)
13. A different parser
- case-insensitive, multiple spaces ("silver coin", ch8)
- something about distUnknownObject (see ch7)
- new struct: object, tag, distance, isDuplicate, passage?
- yacc!
14. light+dark
- a typical feature for games that involve dungeon exploration (Adventure/Zork)
- an attribute 'light' that is set in 2 objects: field + torch
- can only 'look' if there is any lit object with distance < distOverthere
- same for other commands (go, get) - maybe increase distance of objects?
  - distanceTo: swap 3rd and 4th test, and put 'light' check in between
    (checking whether obj->location is lit, or contains a lit object)
- commands 'light' and 'dim' (?); only work on torch --> swapLocation like ch12
- the lamp gets exhausted; this is a sense of 'time'!
15. Savegame
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saved_game
- save the whole objs (+ any other state vars)
  - optimization: only save what is subject to change (location, health)
    - note that location has been used for the state of doors and light too
    - skip pointers, for safety!
  - add a checksum to prevent manipulation
  - or use checkpointing software like CryoPID
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_checkpointing
- alternative: save log instead of state
  - or use a test automation tool
16. Abbreviations (n,e,s,w,u,d,inv; x/exam???)
17. Conversations
- http://www.scribd.com/doc/17682546/Dynamic-Conversation-Engine-Concept
18. How simple it is to add commands (push/pull, move x to y) - refer to ch5
- also: combat!
- maybe rather focus on combat in ch18, plus discuss 'time' (turn-based vs real-time)
19. Performance, space (refer to/from ch6)
20. Database (sqlite)
- replace function pointers (ch11) by enums; have object.awk generate a switch
21. Speech
22. Javascript

"You are in an open field"

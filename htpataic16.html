<h1>How to program a text adventure in C</h1>
<h2>16. Savegame</h2>
<p class="intro">
An adventure with any degree of difficulty
should give the player the opportunity to save his progress,
so he can resume the game at a later time.
</p>
<p>
Typically, adventure games simply save their state to a file on disk.
Basically this means: write every (relevant) variable to a file,
and read them back in again to resume the game.
For reasons of portability and security, it would be wise to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">serialize</a>
the data.
<p>
For a traditional single-player adventure,
an alternative would be for the game to log the player&rsquo;s input.
When the player wants to resume, do a &lsquo;roll-forward&rsquo;;
starting from the initial game state, replay every command.
Unusual as it may be, it brings along a few nice advantages.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The player can browse back through the entire transcription of the game.
It can help a player get over that feeling of
&ldquo;It has been a while since I last played, what was I doing here?&rdquo;
</li>
<li>Makes it easier for the player to &lsquo;undo&rsquo; a command.
Exit the game, edit the log file, resume the game. Why not?
</li>
<li>Makes it harder for the player to cheat.
There simply is no advantage in hacking the log file;
without the right clue (or a friend&rsquo;s savegame),
you will never make it to the other side of that locked door.
</li>
<li>Implementation is simple and generic.
We only have to adjust one function: <i>getInput</i> (see chapter 2).
</li>
<li>Portable by nature.
The log file is a straightforward text file; one command per line.
Do be careful with software updates that alter the game&rsquo;s behavior;
these might invalidate log files created in earlier versions of the game.
</li>
<li>It can help the developer to analyze problems.
After an application crash,
it will be possible to retrace the steps that led to the situation.
</li>
<li>It can help the developer with test automation.
This is explained in the next chapter.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As the game progresses,
the log file will grow, and the time it takes to resume the game will increase.
But with today&rsquo;s hardware,
this can hardly be considered a problem anymore.
</p>

TODO: source code (main.c)
</p>
<p>
Please note that this approach is not suitable for online multi-player games.
For that, it is better to use a database.
This will be discussed in chapter 21.

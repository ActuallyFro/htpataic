<h2>15. Light and dark</h2>
<p class="intro">
In many adventures, a lamp is a vital object.
Without it, you cannot make it through the dark caverns that lie ahead.
</p>
<p>
The effect of being in the dark differs from game to game.
Typically, it makes the command &lsquo;look&rsquo; ineffective.
In some games, you can still make progress without a light source,
provided you have drawn a detailed map of the dark area.
In others (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">Zork</a>),
darkness is deadly.

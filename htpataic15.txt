<h1>How to program a text adventure in C</h1>
<h2>15. Light and dark</h2>
<p class="intro">
In many adventures, a lamp is a vital object.
Without it, you cannot make it through the dark caverns that lie ahead.
</p>
<p>
The effect of being in the dark differs from game to game.
Typically, it makes the command &lsquo;look&rsquo; ineffective.
In some games (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">Zork</a>),
darkness is deadly.
In others, you can still make progress without a light source,
provided you have drawn a detailed map of the dark area.
</p>
<p>
Our game will stay in between;
being in the dark will not get you killed,
but you will not be able to follow any passages either.
An exception will be made for passages that lead back into the light;
it seemed unfair to me to allow the player to run into a dark area,
without an opportunity to get back to where he came from.
</p>
<p>
Alright; so first of all, in darkness you cannot see your surroundings.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>location.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 15 location.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
Secondly, in darkness you cannot see or use nearby objects.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>noun.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 15 noun.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
In both cases, we used a function <i>isLit</i>.
It is defined (and used some more) in <i>misc.c</i>.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>misc.h</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 15 misc.h
</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>misc.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 15 misc.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<div class="explanation">
<p>
Explanation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 13:
we are using whitelists to identify
the locations that are naturally lit (the field)
and any objects that produce light (the lamp).
In a big adventure with more locations
(and maybe more lamps, torches, glowsticks),
it would be wise to introduce an attribute for this;
similar to how we replaced the whitelist of actors
with a 'health' attribute in chapter 10.
</li>
<li>Lines 35 and 65:
nearby objects that remain hidden in the dark,
are being treated as 'not here'.
This naturally prevents the game from leaking information
about objects the player is not supposed to be aware of.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
We will add a lamp the player can carry to get through the dark locations.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>object.txt</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 15 object.txt
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
We will add some commands we can use to turn the lamp on and off.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>parsexec.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 15 parsexec.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
Below is the implementation of these commands.
</p>
<table class="demo">
<tr><th>Sample output</th></tr>
<tr><td>
#test 15
</td></tr>
</table>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>onoff.h</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 15 onoff.h
</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>onoff.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 15 onoff.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
To turn the lamp on and off,
we will use the same trick we used to open and close the door and the box
(see chapter 12).
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>toggle.h</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 15 toggle.h
</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>toggle.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 15 toggle.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<img class="genmap" src="code15/map.png" />
<p>
Finally, we will mark the dark locations in our generated map.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>map.awk</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff 15 map.awk
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
Do be careful not to turn off the lamp after dropping it;
in the dark, you will never be able to find it back!
